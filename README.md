# Go Sleep Script
Hello,
I coded a little virus, the person has to launch application.py
If the person accepts the permissions of the application, his pc shuts down and a script is placed in the start menu (his pc will shut down as soon as he turns it on)

Most importantly, how to disable it if you run it:
-you have 10 seconds before your pc shuts down, you have to go to cmd.exe and run shutdown -a or go to the task manager and disable the go_sleep script at startup Â
